# No-Softside
A harmony patch made for rust, to disable the ability to soft side walls.

**DISCLAIMER**

For this to work it requires the server to disable sandbox, it uses Harmony code which allows me to modify the server code to allow this to be possible. You can find out how to disable sandbox below. After disabling, you can drop the plugin in the plugin folder like normal.

> To disable Sandbox, head to your RustDedicated_Data/Managed folder and create a file called 
oxide.disable-sandbox then restart your server to apply the change.
